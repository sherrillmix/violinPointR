\title{Data on HIV integration sites from several studies}
\format{
A data frame with 12436 rows and 4 variables:
\describe{
  \item{study}{the cell population infected by HIV}
  \item{latent}{whether the provirus was active (expressed) or inactive (latent)}
  \item{nearestGene}{distance to nearest gene (transcription unit) (0 if in a gene)}
  \item{H4K12ac}{number of reads aligned within +- 50,000 bases in a H4K12ac ChIP-Seq}
}

\description{
A dataset containing data from a meta-analysis looking for differences between active and inactive HIV integrations. Each row represents a provirus integrated somewhere in a human chromosome with whether viral expression was detectd, the distance to the nearest gene and the number of reads from H4K12ac ChIP-Seq mapped to within 50,000 bases of the integration.
